The real beauty of WordPress is the immense community of developers behind it.  Several plugins are created and added to the [official plugin directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/) every single day, which now catalogs nearly 10,500 in all!  It's always interesting to check out the newest plugins on WordPress to see what people are up to, and these are among my favorites:

#### [After The Deadline For Comments](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/atd-for-comments/) by [Otto](http://ottodestruct.com/)


If you're not using it, I highly recommend the After the Deadline plugin, which provides contextual spell checking and grammar checking to your blog posts.  This plugin extends that functionality to comments ([demo](http://ottopress.com/wordpress-plugins/atd-for-comments/)).

So this one isn't _that_ new but very worthy of being in the list.  BM Shots is a plugin that makes use of WordPress.com mShots API for automatically creating screenshots of any website.





## Conclusion


I try to visit the new plugins section at least once a week to get an idea of what people are working on, the kinds of problems people are trying to solve and to see if there's anything I can use on my own sites.  I'm always amazed at the sheer amount of creativity that people have when it comes to plugins, it's often very entertaining to browse through.
