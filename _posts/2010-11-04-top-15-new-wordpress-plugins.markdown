When I last wrote about my favorite new plugins in July, there were approximately 10,500 plugins in the official [WordPress Plugin Directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/).  Four months later, that number has reached nearly 12,000!  The following is a list of the best I've found from these new plugins, be sure to check them out:

#### [Publish Confirmation](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/publish-confirmation/) by [BloggingBookShelf](http://www.bloggingbookshelf.com/wordpress/publish-confirmation-plugin/)

Have you ever accidentally published a post before it was ready? Yeah. It sucks. This plugin takes care of that.  When you hit the "Publish" button after writing a post, a small dialog box appears asking you if you're sure you want to publish the post. You can either click OK or CANCEL. And that's it! Super simple and no more acidentally published posts.

</a>

#### [Gravatar Hovercards](http://ottopress.com/2010/gravatar-hovercards/)  by [Otto](http://ottopress.com/)

So this is one isn't an official plugin and thus isn't in the WordPress plugin directory but I thought it was worth mentioning.  [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/) has implemented a new feature which lets you hover over a user's Gravatar to get additional information about them and Otto has created a jQuery/WP plugin that lets you do this on any WordPress blog.  You can see it in action on [his personal blog](http://ottopress.com/2010/gravatar-hovercards/).

#### [Visitor Analytics](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/basic-authentication/) by [Suny Tse](http://ziming.org/dev/visitor-analytics)

This plugin provides pretty detailed information on your latest visitors, including their IP address, number and frequency of visits, time spent on the site and which pages they visited.  All of this information is available in Google Analytics or any log analyzer (ie Awstats), however it can be nice to have this quick summary easily accessible in your WordPress admin section.

#### [WordPress Firewall 2](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-firewall-2/) by [Matthew Pavkov](http://matthewpavkov.com/wordpress-plugins/)

This WordPress plugin investigates web requests with simple, WordPress-specific heuristics, to identify and stop the most obvious attacks.  It intelligently whitelists and blacklists pathological-looking phrases, based on which field they appear within, in a page request (unknown/numeric parameters vs. known post bodies, comment bodies, etc.). Its purpose is not to replace prompt and responsible upgrading, but rather to mitigate 0-day attacks and let bloggers sleep better at night.

## Conclusion

I'll try to continue this series every few months to stay on top of the best new WordPress plugins being released.  If I missed one (undoubtedly so), please post it in the comments so we can check it out!

I wasn't able to find a few author homepage URLs so I used the WordPress profile pages - if you would like me to use your homepage URL instead, post that in the comments as well and I'll update the post.
