It's been a busy month here and I just wanted to take a minute to make a few announcements regarding DevGrow.<!-- more -->



### Monthly Polls


If you notice in the sidebar column, you'll notice a new section entitled 'Monthly Poll.'  Every month, we'll have a new question relevant to web design and development.  At the end of the month, I'll write a post covering the results of the poll and any discussion about it in the [forums](http://devgrow.com/discuss).  If you have a suggestion for a poll, [reply to this thread](http://devgrow.com/discuss/topic/poll-suggestions) with your ideas.



### New Sponsor: [Linode.com](http://devgrow.com/go/linode.com)


An exciting announcement this month is that we've been fortunate enough to have [Linode.com](http://devgrow.com/go/linode.com) sponsor the hosting for this blog!  I switched to Linode nearly 2 years ago and haven't looked back since - they are the absolute best VPS providers in the game right now.  While they are not the cheapest VPS out there (still cheaper than Slicehost), they have incredible service and a solid backend infrastructure to make server administration easier.  Also, I don't think I've had any host-related downtime since switching to them (any downtime has been my own fault).  If you're in the VPS market, I highly recommend you take a look at their services.



### Giveaways


I've been planning a few giveaways for DevGrow, mainly for web development and programming books.  If there is anything you'd like to see in particular (book or otherwise), leave a comment and I will see if it's possible to have that as a giveaway.



### The Road Ahead


I'm still looking for guest authors and contributors - if you are interested in writing an article for DevGrow and getting your 5-minutes of fame (plus traffic), do [get in touch](http://devgrow.com/contribute).  I will be working on an improved layout for the main homepage soon that puts more emphasis on the [Discussion Forum](http://devgrow.com/discuss/) and the [Inspiration Gallery](http://devgrow.com/gallery/), two features of the site that are not getting as much usage as I'd like.

Also, my posting schedule has been slow lately and will continue to be so until the end of October, as have been (and will be) traveling a bit due to work.  I should be back to my regular schedule in November.

If you have any feedback about the site, please leave them in the comments.  Stay tuned for more updates and a new post coming up in the next couple of days!
