Firefox is a free, open-source web browser that is easily extensible with add-ons.  With over 12,000 of them, however, discovering new add-ons can be a chore.  We&#8217;ve compiled a list of more than 25 of the most useful Firefox add-ons for web designers and developers.

## Conclusion

I hope you guys are able to use some of these plugins.  While I don&#8217;t use them all at once, I have tried them all out and the results have been worthwhile (enough that I can recommend them).  That said, **I am sure I missed several great plugins**.  If you have any other recommendations, please leave them in the comments!
