While playing around with JQuery UI's slider widgets, I decided to throw together a quick freelance project estimator.  This is **not based on science or statistics**, so use it with your own judgement.  The 'Client Information' bits shouldn't be taken too seriously either, I added that in to emphasize that the type of client can often dictate quotes too.  By the way, I apologize but the first two sliders can be a little fidgety, likely the result of my poor scripting.
