As SEO becomes an increasingly important part of web development, it's important to make sure your website conforms to the correct standards to help improve your search ranking.  This is an area where you should be willing to spend some money, as the results are often well worth it in terms of increased traffic and customer conversions.

There are a lot of tools out there to help you identify your SEO strengths and weaknesses, from services that monitor your keyword rankings on popular search engines (SERP, or Search Engine Results Page) to more complete, premium solutions that tell you exactly what you should change to make your site rank better.

##### [AuthorityLabs](http://authoritylabs.com/)

Another SERP/keyword monitoring service similar to SEO Rank Monitor but even simpler (more bare-bones).  Their pricing is also similar however they seem to offer a better bang for the buck in terms of number of sites you can watch, and they even have a [live demo](http://demo.authoritylabs.com/overview) which is nice.

##### [SEMRush](http://www.semrush.com/)

I've been playing with this site for the past couple of days but I'm already a fan - you can test it out by going to their site and entering any domain name to find how that site ranks for many keywords.  It's highly useful for finding relevant keywords to build on, however they limit the free results to the top 10 keywords.  Their premium plans start at $59/mo and allow up to 10,000 results per report, plus they give you API access, which is very cool.

##### [SEORush](http://www.seorush.com/)

SEORush provides a quick overview of how well your site is indexed, traffic rankings and the number of social media bookmarks it has for a few popular networks.  I would suggest using this tool together with something like [QuarkBase](http://www.quarkbase.com/) to get a quick overview of the popularity of a site, and to get some quick ideas for keyword generation.
