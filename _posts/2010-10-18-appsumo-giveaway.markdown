##### 1. [Zendesk](http://www.zendesk.com/) - $107 Value


Zendesk is web-based customer support software that provides your support agents with an elegant ticket management and a self-service customer community.  It's agile, smart and convenient.  Zendesk is used by some big names, including [Twitter](http://twitter.com/), [Rackspace](http://rackspace.com/) and [Groupon](http://groupon.com/).

##### 2. [SnapEngage](http://www.snapengage.com/) - $196 Value


SnapEngage lets you chat with your website visitors in real-time using a single line of JavaScript.  You can use GTalk or any free instant messaging client (Pidgin) to instantly talk to your clients, guide them to certain pages and improve their overall experience exponentially.  Don't take my word for it, try it out on their homepage at [SnapEngage.com](http://www.snapengage.com/) - I spent a few minutes chatting with their support guy about a few questions I had about their service and it works great!  Oh, did I mention that they're being used by [GetSatisfaction](http://www.getsatisfaction.com/), [Zynga](http://www.zynga.com/), [iContact](http://www.icontact.com/) and [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/)?

## Why you _need_ this for your business


Customer support is huge for any business, especially ones that are web-based.  Combined, the three services above take care of your entire support system and work together flawlessly (they all integrate with each other) to give your customers the best support imaginable.
