A plugin to cache the Facebook Fan Box.  As the author says, "this plugin was written to take care of a serious issue. We were getting horrible load times on any page that contained the Facebook Fan Box iframe code. Especially during the evenings when everyone else in the world AND their mother was on Facebook playing Farmville and asking ME to join them. I wanted nothing of it, and I didn't want my website to suffer the consequences. So after some research, I wrote up this plugin."

Graceless Degradation checks to see if the current browser is MSIE 6. If it's not, it does nothing. If it is, it injects CSS and JavaScript into the page that:



	
  * Puts Comic Sans fonts everywhere!

	
  * Makes emphasis tags (bold, italic, strong, and underline) blink! Even though IE doesn't support the tag!

	
  * Turns tags into animated rainbows!

	
  * Finds "mailto:" links and tacks on animated mailbox graphics!








## Conclusion


The last plugin is probably my favorite of the bunch, as it makes corny any blog when viewed in Internet Explorer 6.  What better deterrent to using an outdated browser than every blog you view looking like a [Geocities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) site?
