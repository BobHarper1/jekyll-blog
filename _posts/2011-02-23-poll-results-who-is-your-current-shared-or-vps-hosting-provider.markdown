It turns out that the majority of readers here use either [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/), [Linode](http://devgrow.com/go/linode.com), [MediaTemple](http://www.mediatemple.net/) or [Host Gator](http://devgrow.com/hostgator) as your current shared or VPS hosting provider.  Somehow GoDaddy had the most votes (by a small margin) and, at least for me, is the most surprising result.  Here's a pretty pie graph of the complete spread:<!-- more -->

For those of you who use GoDaddy, I am very curious - why did you decide to go with them?  While I use them to host over 40 domain names, I find their overall site and service to be completely gimmicky, spammy and a cluttered mess of sales pitches.  I only use them for domains because it is a bit of a pain to transfer elsewhere, though I may just take the plunge and do that soon, ridding myself of the awful user experience that is GoDaddy.com.

Thankfully, [Linode](http://devgrow.com/go/linode.com) was the second most popular host.  I've been recommending them from before they started sponsoring DevGrow and I cannot say enough good things about their overall service, including bang-for-buck, reliability and customer care.  I've used them all in the past - 1and1, DreamHost, Host Gator, [Slicehost](http://www.slicehost.com/), [BlueHost](http://www.bluehost.com/) and Media Temple - and **NOTHING compares to Linode**.  On that note, however, it is not for everyone.  You have to have a general idea of how to configure your own server to get things working properly, or at least have some interest in it to follow along their [stellar guides and tutorials](http://library.linode.com/).  Someone without any experience can be up and running in a few hours and get everything working smoothly over a day or two.  The benefits are well worth it, from the total control you have over your server to the knowledge/experience you gain.

### New Poll: What Code Editor Do You Use?



I'm curious as to what code editor you guys use on a daily basis.  Also, what do you use it for - programming or CSS/HTML?  I wish there was a way I could get more info directly in the poll itself but additional details will have to wait until I post the results.
